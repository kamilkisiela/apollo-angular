Handling local resolvers through the addition of an ",Object(l.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ApolloLink")," was a great starting point, and proved that ",Object(l.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"@client")," based queries make sense, and work really well for local state management."),Object(l.b)("p",null,"While ",Object(l.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"apollo-link-state")," achieved some of the goals of local state handling, the information available when using any ",Object(l.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ApolloLink")," is limited by the modularity of the link system. We consider local state management a core part of the Apollo ecosystem, and as Apollo Client progresses, we want to make sure local resolvers are integrated as tightly as possible into core.
