  Apollo Angular introduces a new approach of working with GraphQL in Angular by providing Query,
  Mutation and Subscription APIs. This approach makes GraphQL Documents first-class citizens, and
  the new APIs are easy to use and generate.

# Query, Mutation, Subscription Services

If you're familiar with the library, you already know the Apollo service. It is a regular Angular
service, pretty much the only one you need to use.

The API is straightforward, `query` and `watchQuery` methods for Queries, `mutate` and `subscribe`
accordingly for Mutations and Subscriptions. There is more than that but if you don't do anything
advanced that's all you really need.

We decided to introduce a new approach of working with GraphQL in Angular.

There are now 3 new APIs: `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`. Each of them allows to define the
shape of a result & variables. The only thing you need to do is to set the document property. That’s
it, you use it as a regular Angular service.

In this approach GraphQL Documents are first-class citizens, you think about the query, for example,
as a main subject.

<Callout>
  The best part about the new API is that you don't have to create those services, there's a tool
  that does it for you.

## Query

To get started with the new API, let's see how you define queries with it.

You create a service and extend it with a `Query` class from `apollo-angular`. Only thing you need
to set is a `document` property.

```ts
import { gql, Query } from 'apollo-angular';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

export interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  votes: number;
  author: {
    id: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  };
}
export interface Response {
  posts: Post[];
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AllPostsGQL extends Query<Response> {
  document = gql`
    query allPosts {
      posts {
        id
        title
        votes
        author {
          id
          firstName
          lastName
        }
      }
    }
  `;
}
```

We have now a ready to use GraphQL Query that takes advantage of `Apollo` service under the hood.

### Basic Example

Let's see how to actually use it in a component:

```ts
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
// import a service
import { AllPostsGQL, Post } from './graphql';

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class ListComponent implements OnInit {
  posts: Observable<Post[]>;

  // inject it
  constructor(private readonly allPostsGQL: AllPostsGQL) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // use it!
    this.posts = this.allPostsGQL.watch().valueChanges.pipe(map(result => result.data.posts));
  }
}
```

### Example with Variables

```ts
@Component({
  // ...
})
export class ListComponent implements OnInit {
  // ...

  ngOnInit() {
    // variables as first argument
    // options as second
    this.posts = this.allPostsGQL
      .watch(
        {
          first: 10,
        },
        {
          fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
        },
      )
      .valueChanges.pipe(map(result => result.data.posts));
  }
}
```

### API of Query

`Query` class has two methods:

- `watch(variables?, options?)` - it's the same as `Apollo.watchQuery` except it accepts variables
  as a first argument and regular options as the second one
- `fetch(variables?, options?)` - same as `Apollo.query`, it fetches data once.

## Mutation

You create a service and extend it with a `Mutation` class from `apollo-angular`. Only thing you
need to set is a `document` property.

```ts
import { gql, Mutation } from 'apollo-angular';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class UpvotePostGQL extends Mutation {
  document = gql`
    mutation upvotePost($postId: Int!) {
      upvotePost(postId: $postId) {
        id
        votes
      }
    }
  `;
}
```

We have now a ready to use GraphQL Mutation.

### Basic Example

Let's see how to actually use it in a component:

```ts
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { UpvotePostGQL } from './graphql';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-upvoter',
  template: `<button (click)="upvote()">Upvote</button>`,
})
export class UpvoterComponent {
  @Input()
  postId: number;

  constructor(private readonly upvotePostGQL: UpvotePostGQL) {}

  upvote() {
    this.upvotePostGQL
      .mutate({
        postId: this.postId,
      })
      .subscribe();
  }
}
```

### API of Mutation

`Mutation` class has only one method:

- `mutate(variables?, options?)` - it's the same as `Apollo.mutate` except it accepts variables as a
  first argument and regular options as the second one.

## Subscription

You create a service and extend it with a `Subscription` class from `apollo-angular`. Only thing you
need to set is a `document` property.

```ts
import { gql, Subscription } from 'apollo-angular';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class NewPostGQL extends Subscription {
  document = gql`
    subscription newPost {
      newPost {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  `;
}
```

We have now a ready to use GraphQL Subscription.

### Basic Example

Let's see how to actually use it in a component:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NewPostGQL } from './graphql';

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class ActivityComponent {
  constructor(newPostGQL: NewPostGQL) {
    this.lastPost = newPostGQL.subscribe();
  }
}
```

### API of Subscription

`Subscription` class has only one method:

- `subscribe(variables?, options?, extraOptions?)` - it's the same as `Apollo.subscribe` except its
  first argument expect variables.

## Code Generation

There's a tool to generate a ready to use in your component, strongly typed Angular services, for
every defined query, mutation or subscription.

In short, you define a query in `.graphql` file so your IDE gives you autocompletion and validation.

```graphql
query allPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    votes
    author {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```

Code generation tool outputs to a file, a fully featured service called `AllPostsGQL` with every
interface you will need.

```ts
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
// import a service and a type from the generated output
import { AllPostsGQL, Post } from './generated';

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class ListComponent implements OnInit {
  posts: Observable<Post[]>;

  // inject it
  constructor(private readonly allPostsGQL: AllPostsGQL) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // use it!
    this.posts = this.allPostsGQL.watch().valueChanges.pipe(map(result => result.data.posts));
  }
}
```
