# Get Started

## Installation

### Installation with Angular Schematics

The simplest way to get started with Apollo Angular is by executing the schematic like this:

```sh
ng add apollo-angular
```

**Done!** You can now create your first query, [let's go through it together here](#request-data).

### Installation without Angular Schematics

If you want to setup Apollo without the help of Angular Schematics, first, let's install some
packages:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i apollo-angular @apollo/client graphql
```

- `@apollo/client`: Where the magic happens
- `apollo-angular`: Bridge between Angular and Apollo Client
- `graphql`: Second most important package

The `@apollo/client` package requires `AsyncIterable` so make sure your `tsconfig.json` includes
`ES2020` or later:

```jsonc filename="tsconfig.json" /"es2020"/
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "lib": ["es2020", "dom"],
  },
}
```

Great, now that you have all the dependencies you need, let's create your first Apollo Client.

In `app.config.ts` file, provide Apollo with some options:

```ts filename="app.config.ts"
import { provideApollo } from 'apollo-angular';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-angular/http';
import { provideHttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { ApplicationConfig, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client/core';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideHttpClient(),
    provideApollo(() => {
      const httpLink = inject(HttpLink);

      return {
        link: httpLink.create({ uri: '/graphql' }),
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
        // other options...
      };
    }),
  ],
};
```

Take a closer look what we did there:

1. With `apollo-angular/http` and `HttpLink` service we connect our client to an external GraphQL
   Server
1. Thanks to `@apollo/client/core` and `InMemoryCache` we have a place to store data in

## Links and Cache

Apollo Angular has a pluggable network interface layer, which can let you configure how queries are
sent over HTTP, or replace the whole network part with something completely custom, like a websocket
transport, mocked server data, or anything else you can imagine.

One Link that you already have in your application is called `HttpLink` which uses HTTP to send your
queries.

The `InMemoryCache` is the default cache implementation for Apollo Client 3.0.

## Request Data

Once all is hooked up, you're ready to start requesting data with `Apollo` service!

The `Apollo` is an Angular service exported from `apollo-angular` to share GraphQL data with your
UI.

First, pass your GraphQL query wrapped in the `gql` or `graphql` function (from `apollo-angular`) to
the `query` property in the `Apollo.watchQuery` method, in your component. The `Apollo` service is a
regular angular service available to you, and your data is streamed through Observables.

The `watchQuery` method returns a `QueryRef` object which has the `valueChanges` property that is an
`Observable`.

An object passed through an Observable contains `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties. Apollo
Client tracks error and loading state for you, which will be reflected in the `loading` and `error`
properties. Once the result of your query comes back, it will be attached to the `data` property.

<Callout>
  It's also possible to fetch data only once. The `query` method of `Apollo` service returns an
  `Observable` that also resolves with the same result as above.
</Callout>

Let's create an `ExchangeRates` component to see the `Apollo` service in action!

### Basic Operations

If you want to see how easy it is to fetch data from a GraphQL server with Apollo, you can use the
`query` method. It is as easy as this:

```ts
import { Apollo, gql } from 'apollo-angular';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'exchange-rates',
  template: `
    @if (loading) {
      <div>Loading...</div>
    }
    @if (error) {
      <div>Error :(</div>
    }
    @if (rates) {
      @for (rate of rates; track $index) {
        <p>{{ rate.currency }}: {{ rate.rate }}</p>
      }
    }
  `,
})
export class ExchangeRates implements OnInit {
  rates: any[];
  loading = true;
  error: any;

  constructor(private readonly apollo: Apollo) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.apollo
      .watchQuery({
        query: gql`
          {
            rates(currency: "USD") {
              currency
              rate
            }
          }
        `,
      })
      .valueChanges.subscribe((result: any) => {
        this.rates = result.data?.rates;
        this.loading = result.loading;
        this.error = result.error;
      });
  }
}
```

Congrats, you just made your first query! 🎉 If you render your `ExchangeRates` component within
your `App` component from the previous example, you'll first see a loading indicator and then data
on the page once it's ready. Apollo Client automatically caches this data when it comes back from
the server, so you won't see a loading indicator if you run the same query twice.

If you'd like to play around with the app we just built, you can view it on
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/basic-apollo-angular-app). Don't stop there! Try building
more components with `Apollo` service and experimenting with the concepts you just learned.

## Named Clients

It is possible to have several apollo clients in the application, for example, pointing to different
endpoints.

See [how to use multiple clients](./recipes/multiple-clients).

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to fetch data with Apollo Angular, you're ready to dive deeper into
creating more complex queries and mutations. After this section, we recommend moving onto:

- [Queries](./data/queries): Learn how to fetch queries with arguments and dive deeper into
  configuration options
- [Mutations](./data/mutations): Learn how to update data with mutations and when you'll need to
  update the Apollo cache
- [Apollo Client API](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient): Sometimes, you'll
  need to access the client directly like we did in our plain JavaScript example above. Visit the
  API reference for a full list of options
