# Integrating with NativeScript

You can use Apollo with NativeScript exactly as you would with normal Angular application.

To introduce Apollo to your app, install `apollo-angular` from npm and use them in your app as
outlined in the [setup](../get-started) article:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i apollo-angular
```

<Callout>
  **Note**: There are more packages to be installed, so check out the "initialization" article.
</Callout>

```ts filename="app.config.ts"
import { provideApollo } from 'apollo-angular';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-angular/http';
import { NativeScriptHttpClientModule } from 'nativescript-angular/http-client';
import { NativeScriptModule } from 'nativescript-angular/nativescript.module';
import { ApplicationConfig, importProvidersFrom, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client/core';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    importProvidersFrom(NativeScriptModule, NativeScriptHttpClientModule), // this provides HttpClient
    provideApollo(() => {
      const httpLink = inject(HttpLink);

      return {
        link: httpLink.create({ uri: '/graphql' }),
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
        // other options ...
      };
    }),
  ],
};
```

If you are new to using Apollo with Angular, you should probably read the [Angular guide](/).

## Examples

There are some Apollo examples written in NativeScript that you may wish to refer to:
