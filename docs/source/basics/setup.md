<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

The simplest way to get started with Apollo Angular is by running `ng add apollo-angular` command.

<h2 id="with-schematics">Installation with Angular Schematics</h2>

We support `ng-add` command now.

To start using Apollo Angular simply run:

```bash
ng add apollo-angular
```

One thing you need to set is the URL of your GraphQL Server, so open `src/app/graphql.module.ts` and set `uri` variables:

```typescript
const uri = 'https://w5xlvm3vzz.lp.gql.zone/graphql'; //our test Graphql Server which returns rates
```

**Done!** You can now create your first query, [**let's go through it together here**](#request)

<h2 id="without-schematics">Installation without Angular Schematics</h2>

If you want to setup Apollo without the help of Angular Schematics, first, let's install some packages:

```bash
npm install --save apollo-angular \
  apollo-angular-link-http \
  apollo-link \
  apollo-client \
  apollo-cache-inmemory \
  graphql-tag \
  graphql
```

- `apollo-client`: Where the magic happens
- `apollo-angular`: Bridge between Angular and Apollo Client
- `apollo-cache-inmemory`: Our recommended cache
- `apollo-angular-link-http`: An Apollo Link for remote data fetching
- `graphql`: Second most important package
- `graphql-tag`: Parses your strings to GraphQL documents

The `apollo-client` package requires `AsyncIterable` so make sure your tsconfig.json includes `esnext.asynciterable`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "lib": [
      "es2017",
      "dom",
      "esnext.asynciterable"
    ]
  }
}
```

Great, now that you have all the dependencies you need, let's create your first Apollo Client.

In our `app.module.ts` file use `ApolloModule` and `APOLLO_OPTIONS` token to configure Apollo Client:

```ts
import { HttpClientModule } from "@angular/common/http";
import { ApolloModule, APOLLO_OPTIONS } from "apollo-angular";
import { HttpLinkModule HttpLink } from "apollo-angular-link-http";
import { InMemoryCache } from "apollo-cache-inmemory";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    ApolloModule,
    HttpLinkModule
  ],
  providers: [{
    provide: APOLLO_OPTIONS,
    useFactory(httpLink: HttpLink) {
      return {
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
        link: httpLink.create({
          uri: "https://w5xlvm3vzz.lp.gql.zone/graphql"
        })
      }
    },
    deps: [HttpLink]
  }],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Take a closer look what we did there:

1. With `apollo-angular-link-http` and `HttpLink` service we connect our client to an external GraphQL Server
1. Thanks to `apollo-cache-inmemory` and `InMemoryCache` we have a place to store data in
1. `APOLLO_OPTIONS` provides options to Apollo Client

Apollo's HttpLink requires `HttpClient` so that's why we also used `HttpClientModule` from `@angular/common/http`.

<h2 id="links-cache">Links and Cache</h2>

Apollo Client has a pluggable network interface layer, which can let you configure how queries are sent over HTTP, or replace the whole network part with something completely custom, like a websocket transport, mocked server data, or anything else you can imagine.

One Link that you already have in your application is called `apollo-angular-link-http` which uses HTTP to send your queries.

`apollo-cache-inmemory` is the default cache implementation for Apollo Client 2.0. InMemoryCache is a normalized data store that supports all of Apollo Client 1.0’s features without the dependency on Redux.

<h2 id="request">Request data</h2>

Once all is hooked up, you're ready to start requesting data with `Apollo` service!

`Apollo` is an Angular service exported from `apollo-angular` to share GraphQL data with your UI.

First, pass your GraphQL query wrapped in the `gql` function (from `graphql-tag`) to the `query` property in the `Apollo.watchQuery` method, in your component.
The `Apollo` service is a regular angular service that you familiar with, data are being streamed through Observables. Same here.

The `watchQuery` method returns a `QueryRef` object which has the `valueChanges`
property that is an `Observable`.

An object passed through an Observable contains `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties. Apollo Client tracks error and loading state for you, which will be reflected in the `loading` and `error` properties. Once the result of your query comes back, it will be attached to the `data` property.

> It's also possible to fetch data only once. The `query` method of `Apollo` service returns an `Observable` that also resolves with the same result as
> above.

Let's create an `ExchangeRates` component to see the `Apollo` service in action!

<h3 id="basic-operations">Basic Operations</h3>
If you want to see how easy it is to fetch data from a GraphQL server with Apollo, you can use the `query` method. It is as easy as this:

```ts
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {Apollo} from 'apollo-angular';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

@Component({
  selector: 'exchange-rates',
  template: `
    <div *ngIf="loading">
      Loading...
    </div>
    <div *ngIf="error">
      Error :(
    </div>
    <div *ngIf="rates">
      <div *ngFor="let rate of rates">
        <p>{{rate.currency}}: {{rate.rate}}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class ExchangeRates implements OnInit {
  rates: any[];
  loading = true;
  error: any;

  constructor(private apollo: Apollo) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.apollo
      .watchQuery({
        query: gql`
          {
            rates(currency: "USD") {
              currency
              rate
            }
          }
        `,
      })
      .valueChanges.subscribe(result => {
        this.rates = result.data && result.data.rates;
        this.loading = result.loading;
        this.error = result.error;
      });
  }
}
```

Congrats, you just made your first query! 🎉 If you render your `ExchangeRates` component within your `App` component from the previous example, you'll first see a loading indicator and then data on the page once it's ready. Apollo Client automatically caches this data when it comes back from the server, so you won't see a loading indicator if you run the same query twice.

If you'd like to play around with the app we just built, you can view it on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/basic-apollo-angular-app). Don't stop there! Try building more components with `Apollo` service and experimenting with the concepts you just learned.
