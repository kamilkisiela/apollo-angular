# [Apollo Angular](https://www.apollo-angular.com/) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/apollo-angular.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/apollo-angular)

Apollo Angular allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the Angular framework. Apollo Angular may be used in any context that Angular may be used. In the browser, in NativeScript, or in Node.js when you want to do server-side rendering.

Apollo Angular requires _no_ complex build setup to get up and running. As long as you have a GraphQL server you can get started building out your application with Angular immediately. Apollo Angular works out of the box with both [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) (`ng add apollo-angular`) and [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) with a single install.

Apollo Angular is:

1. **Incrementally adoptable**, so that you can drop it into an existing JavaScript app and start using GraphQL for just part of your UI.
1. **Universally compatible**, so that Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL server, and any GraphQL schema.
1. **Simple to get started with**, so you can start loading data right away and learn about advanced features later.
1. **Inspectable and understandable**, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app.
1. **Built for interactive apps**, so your users can make changes and see them reflected in the UI immediately.
1. **Small and flexible**, so you don't get stuff you don't need. The core is under 12kb compressed.
1. **Community driven**, because Apollo is driven by the community and serves a variety of use cases. Everything is planned and developed in the open.

Get started today on the app you’ve been dreaming of, and let Apollo Angular take you to the moon!

## Installation

It is simple to install Apollo Angular and related libraries

```bash
# installing Apollo Angular in Angular CLI
ng add apollo-angular

# installing each piece independently
yarn add @apollo/client apollo-angular graphql
```

That’s it! You may now use Apollo Angular in any of your Angular environments.

For an amazing developer experience you may also install the [Apollo Client Developer tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm) which will give you inspectability into your Apollo Angular data.

- If you are using Apollo-Client v3, please make sure to use `apollo-angular@v3`
> If you are using Apollo-Client v2, please make sure to use `apollo-angular@v1` (and for Angular 10 support, make sure to use `v1.10.0`)

## Usage

Now you may create components that are connected to your GraphQL API.

Finally, to demonstrate the power of Apollo Angular in building interactive UIs let us connect one of your components to your GraphQL server using the `Apollo` service:

```ts
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {Apollo, gql} from 'apollo-angular';

const GET_DOGS = gql`
  {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
    }
  }
`;

@Component({
  selector: 'dogs',
  template: `
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let dog of dogs | async">
        {{dog.breed}}
      </li>
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class DogsComponent implements OnInit {
  dogs: Observable<any>;

  constructor(private apollo: Apollo) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.dogs = this.apollo
      .watchQuery({
        query: GET_DOGS,
      })
      .valueChanges.pipe(map(result => result.data && result.data.dogs));
  }
}
```
